the View (the user interface), and the Controller (the logic that handles user input and controls the flow of the application).

The SQL Server database is used to store and manage the data required by the website, including user information, hostel details, and booking records.
The website likely uses Entity Framework, a popular object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET, to access the database and handle data operations.
Entity Framework allows developers to work with databases using strongly-typed entities and LINQ queries, which helps improve code quality and maintainability.

Overall, your project involves integrating multiple technologies and frameworks to build a scalable, secure, and user-friendly hostel website that meets the needs of both users and hostel owners.
